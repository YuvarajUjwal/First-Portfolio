This is my first simple portfolio website.

After learning the basics of front end development and ReactJS, I wanted my own portfolio website.

It is designed using ReactJS , Tailwind CSS and Vite.

Although, the interface might not look great, I am happy because it laid the foundation for me to create web apps using React.
